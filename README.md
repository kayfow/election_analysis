### Audit Summary
It is proposed that the following be considered during the next congressional campaign:
* Additional outreach and campaigning for each candidate to be done in Arapahoe and Jefferson, each county having significant low voter turnout compared to Denver. 
* This script can also be modified by breaking down further the specific candidates representation within each county to see who may or may not need to redistribute outreach and campaigning efforts in that respective county moving forward.
